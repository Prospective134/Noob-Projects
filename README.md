Hi, this is my first project, a typing practice that I made with tkinter, since I was already practicing my typing method in my free time. Might as well make one that was more suited to my needs and had the functionality I wanted in other type practices.
Just download all the files and put it in pycharm, it should work, if it doesn't please let me know. Thanks
